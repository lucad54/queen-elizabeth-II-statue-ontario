mmcl001,,,SZ4r2DNrE5A,York University Libraries Making & Media Creation Lab intro video,video/mpeg,"The Media Creation Lab was opened in 2022 with a small seed grant and had the values of inclusivity and accessibility at its heart. Despite being open for about two years, students are often still unaware of the services and tools we provide – and since we focus on making media creation accessible for beginners, these first-time creators are precisely the people we want to reach. Moreover, the Libraries are gearing up to open a second location at our new Markham campus library in September 2024, making awareness of what we offer even more crucial. This video is intended to centre our accessible, safe-space approach, with a focus on how we put media creation within faculty, staff and students’ grasp, no matter their department or program or how new they are to the tools.",York University Libraries,,,,youtube video,,,,,,,,,,,,Audio,eng,
